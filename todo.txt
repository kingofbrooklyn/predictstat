upload file without being logged in causes odd error
files not being deleted in media
still need to set files to None to pass validation?
keep same component open on refresh
form error page redisplay working?
implement connections ('component' class one-to-one, 'connections' fields), change is_updated checks in context

add component types
-scatter xy

add tooltip helps on forms
account delete, edit profile info


flesh out component content
-dataset
---scroll bar on data
---basic statistics (sample size, mean, std dev, min max)
-regression
---option for validation (maybe during fitting)
---surface/line plots
---validation results
-visualization
---resize option
